## 📝 Notes

### Development Principles
1. **Test-Driven**: Write tests before or alongside implementation
2. **Performance-First**: Profile early, optimize based on data
3. **Modular Design**: Each system should be independently testable
4. **Clean Code**: Readable, maintainable, well-documented
5. **Cross-Platform**: Consider portability in every design decision

### Risk Mitigation
- **Vulkan Complexity**: Start with simple rendering, expand gradually
- **Performance Targets**: Profile frequently, optimize bottlenecks early
- **Cross-Platform Issues**: Test on both platforms regularly
- **Memory Management**: Implement comprehensive tracking from start
- **Build Complexity**: Keep build system simple and well-documented

### Future Considerations
- **Modding API**: Design systems for extensibility
- **Asset Pipeline**: Plan for content creation tools
- **Scripting**: Consider lua or similar for game logic
- **VR Support**: Ensure rendering architecture can support VR
- **Mobile Platforms**: Consider Vulkan mobile profile support
