- [ ] Implement memory cleanup and defragmentation logic.
- [ ] Integrate with the context key system for unified memory.

### `src/utils/http.c` (HTTP Client)

## ü§ñ Phase 3: LLM Integration

This phase connects the agent to the Large Language Model.

### `src/llm/` (LLM Client Architecture)
- [ ] **`context_builder.c`**: Implement functions to prepare the full context string to be sent to the LLM.
- [ ] **`prompt_manager.c`**: Implement logic to construct the final prompt, combining the state-specific system prompt with the current context.

## üîÑ Phase 4: State Machine & Core Logic

This phase implements the agent's autonomous behavior and state management.

### `src/state/` (State Implementations)
- [ ] **`enhanced_states.c`**: Implement shared utilities for state transitions, including context width management calls.

- [ ] **`paging.c`**: Implement `state_paging_execute()` and `llm_request_context_paging()`. This function will call the LLM with a paging prompt and execute the returned directives (`move_to_disk`, etc.) by calling the context manager.

### `src/agent/` (Agent Core)
- [ ] **`decision.c`**: Implement logic for decision-making based on LLM output.
- [ ] **`execution.c`**: Implement the engine for performing tasks described in `<action>` tags.
- [ ] **`evaluation.c`**: Implement logic to process metrics from the `<evaluation>` tag.
- [ ] **`core.c`**: Implement the main agent state machine loop (`agent_run()`). The loop should call the appropriate state function, handle the state transition, and run perpetually (`max_iterations: -1`).

### `src/memory/enhanced_llm.c`
- [ ] Implement LLM-driven memory decision functions (e.g., suggesting tags, deciding on retention strategies).
